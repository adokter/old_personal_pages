### Monday 12-10-2015

We first identified a to-do list for this week

1. Define output format of the bird algorithm and nomenclature of quantities
1. Make inventory of Z and V data availability and Nyquist intervals for each radar
1. Implement output format in ODIM-h5
1. Compile base and refactored versions on the ODE (Opera Development Environment) of BALTRAD
1. Select time period for testing (9-11 October 2015 as first option). Look at OPERA composites to identify regions with precipitation
1. Compare output of both versions
1. Apply algorithm to all data for 9-11 October
1. Visualize output
1. Analyze output
1. Process data from Angelhom radar for the validation campaign
	- conversion EEC data format of SMHI to ODIM-h5
	- calculate VPBs (vertical profiles of birds)
1. Determine strategy for handling data requests and support by ENRAM members
1. Prepare presentation for WG1&2 meeting in the Netherlands
1. Operationally implement the algorithm on BALTRAD server

Discussion Anders Henja:
1. need to change vol2bird code such that it no longer uses global objects to contain the data

To install RAVE as a stand-alone library:

```
git clone git://git.baltrad.eu/rave.git
git clone git://git.baltrad.eu/hlhdf.git
```
./setup --prefix=/opt/baltrad --subsystems=STANDALONE_RAVE

port install numpy-27
