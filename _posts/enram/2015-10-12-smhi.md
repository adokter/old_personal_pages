### Monday 12-10-2015

We first identified a to-do list for this week

1. Define output format of the bird algorithm and nomenclature of quantities
2. Implement output format in ODIM-h5
3. Compile base and refactored versions on the ODE (Opera Development Environment) of BALTRAD
4. Compare output of both versions
5. Select time period for testing (9-11 October 2015 as first option). Look at OPERA composites to identify regions with precipitation
6. Process data from Anelhom radar for the validation campaign
	- conversion EEC data format to ODIM-h5
	- calculate VPBs (vertical profiles of birds)
7. Make inventory of Z and V data availability and Nyquist intervals for each radar
8. Apply algorithm to all data for 9-11 October
9. Visualize output
10. Analyze output
11. Determine strategy for handling data requests by ENRAM members
12. (optional) Operationally implement the algorithm on BALTRAD server
