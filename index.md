#### Research Interests
Iâ€™m an ecologist with a background in physicis, who works at the interface of movement and foraging ecology. My research focuses on understanding the distribution, seasonal migration and abundance of animals in terms of underlying behavioural mechanisms, in order to predict the effects of (human-induced) habitat change on the fitness of individuals and populations within the full complexity of natural ecosystems.

I like to use my quantitative and mathematical skills to develop data-intensive, state-of-the-art observational techniques, and analyse novel observations within the framework of dynamic mathematical models. To be able to make mechanistic inferences, I use behaviour-based models that can capture both the movement decisions and foraging behaviour of animals, but also provide a realistic reconstruction of the dynamic environment in which my study animals live and interact with. The increasing availability of big data and data-rich observational techniques provides great opportunities for ecology to advance as a predictive science, which is more important than ever given the imminent - but all to often poorly quantified - negative impacts of global human-induced habitat change on the fitness of individuals and populations. 

At the [Netherlands Institute of Ecology](http://nioo.knaw.nl) I currently study the migration and habitat requirements of Brent Geese, a small goose species that breeds in the high arctic, which in winter is highly dependent on natural eelgrass habitats, one of the most endangered ecosystems in Western Europe.
