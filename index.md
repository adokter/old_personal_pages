#### Research Interests
Iâ€™m an ecologist with a background in physicis, with an interest in animal movement and foraging ecology. 
My research bridges the disciplines of physics, meteorology, computer science and ecology, addressing questions on the effects of global change on the distribution and seasonal migration of birds.

At the [Netherlands Institute of Ecology](http://nioo.knaw.nl) I study the migration and habitat requirements of Brent Geese, a small goose species that breeds in the high arctic, which in winter is highly dependent on natural eelgrass habitats, one of the most endangered ecosystems in Western Europe. 

I am also an expert in the use of weather radar to study bird migration. Using networks of weather radars I study the migration corridors of small songbirds at the scale of a full continent, a perspective that is still largely missing.

In the [European Network for Radar surveillance of Animal Movement (ENRAM)](http://www.enram.eu) I lead the algorithm development working group.
